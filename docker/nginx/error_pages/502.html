        <h1> The requested container is stopped :(
        <h2> How do I fix this?
        <p> The container you requested exists but it's currently down.
        <p> You can start it by running:
        <pre>$ gdev up</pre>
        <p> If it fails to start you can see the status of all containers by running:
        <pre>$ gdev ps</pre>

        <p>If this doesn't help look into the <a href="https://github.com/devgeniem/gdev#troubleshooting">troubleshooting guide ( in Github )</a>.</p>
