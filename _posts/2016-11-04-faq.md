You can find few usual error scenarios here. If these don't fix your problems please open issue in [Github](https://github.com/devgeniem/gdev/issues/).

On any error, the first thing to do is to restart Docker and update gdev and see if the problem sorts itself out

```bash
# This updates gdev
$ gdev update
```

## Q: How to stop WordPress caching into redis?

I think that I can't see changes in the site because of the multiple caches in use.

# This stops object cache and full page cache
$ gdev stop redis
```

## Q: OSX: My filesync is not working
**A:Try to restart your machine and run `gdev reload` on your project.**

## Q: Cannot start service dnsmasq
If you get the error:
```
ERROR: for dnsmasq  Cannot start service dnsmasq: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint gdev_dnsmasq_1 (29f672090fc22c5a9e0e210673a6aa3924cf9fc39d691d571eead4153ee466ce): Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 10.254.254.254:53: unexpected error (Failure EADDRNOTAVAIL)
```
**A: Updating pip and gdev might help**
```bash
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ gdev update
```
After this you can try upping your project again.

## Q: My site gives me connection refused error

**A: Check that service Nginx container is running**

Start by doing `gdev service status` to see if Nginx container is running.

If not, you can try `gdev service restart`

If that does not help check `gdev service logs | grep nginx` to see if there is some error in the config.

Sometimes old containers can introduce corrupting configuration to Nginx. In that case you can try `gdev cleanup`
 to get rid of dangling and conflicting containers. Note! This method removes all your databases! Take database backups before running.
